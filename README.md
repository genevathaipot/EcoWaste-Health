# EcoWaste Health

A blockchain-powered platform for managing medical waste in healthcare facilities, ensuring transparent tracking, proper disposal, and incentives for sustainable practices — reducing environmental harm and promoting public health.

---

## Overview

EcoWaste Health consists of four main smart contracts that together create a decentralized system for healthcare providers, waste handlers, and regulators to track medical waste from generation to disposal, while rewarding eco-friendly behaviors:

1. **Waste Token Contract** – Issues and manages tokens for incentivizing proper waste handling.
2. **Tracking NFT Contract** – Represents waste batches as NFTs for immutable traceability.
3. **Compliance DAO Contract** – Enables governance and voting on waste management standards.
4. **Rewards Distribution Contract** – Automates payouts based on verified disposal and recycling.

## Features

- **Token-based incentives** for healthcare facilities and handlers who follow sustainable practices  
- **NFT tracking** for waste batches with real-time status updates  
- **DAO governance** for community-driven regulations and audits  
- **Automated rewards** for verified recycling and compliant disposal  
- **Oracle integration** for off-chain verification of waste processing events  
- **Transparent audit trails** to prevent illegal dumping and ensure health safety
